#### Introduction

At a glance, making a game should be extremely easy. You get an idea, everything makes perfect sense, and it should be simple to make. However, there are things in between going from an idea to a reality that we tend to forget. These are the problems that make game developers simply flop. Worst still, these problems apply to all things, not just games. Amazing innovations and ideas have died off because these problems were not addressed.

You are now on part 3 of the tutorial. In this part, we will cover identifying the core of our game idea.

<br/>
Let's Begin!

##### Recap

In the last part we went over breaking down an idea into smaller components. By doing this we can more easily see what we'll need to work on to make our game. As well, breaking down the idea will help in identifying the core. Please keep in mind that these ideas apply to and can be useful in all types of problems.

##### Identify the core

This will be easier for some more than others. You have to unmarry yourself from every single aspect of the idea you have in mind. Look at it objectively and think: At the very base of things, what is this game? For example, Halo is a multiplayer sci-fi fps with a unique storyline and character customization. Alternatively, Halo is a first-person shooter. Basically, you want to focus on identifying the genre of your idea. The core of the example idea would be "sh'mup". Be sure to write that down too. It would also be a good idea to label it as "Core Game" and label every other aspect of your idea as "Features".

#### Conclusion

If you've made it to here, you've done well. But we've only scratched the surface! In this post you planned the first steps to making your game. By Identifying the core, you set a clear and achievable goal and addressed the problem of scope creep. Next we will move on to the designing of our core game, then do a bit more planning.
