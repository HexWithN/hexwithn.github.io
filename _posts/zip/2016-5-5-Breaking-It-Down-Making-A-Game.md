#### Introduction

At a glance, making a game should be extremely easy. You get an idea, everything makes perfect sense, and it should be simple to make. However, there are things in between going from an idea to a reality that we tend to forget. These are the problems that make game developers simply flop. Worst still, these problems apply to all things, not just games. Amazing innovations and ideas have died off because these problems were not addressed.

You are now on part 2 of the tutorial. In this part, we will cover breaking down our amazing game idea into its smaller parts.

Let's Begin!

#### Recap

In the last post we went over proper planning and identifying what exactly we're making for our game. Our example game idea is "a multiplayer space sh'mup with customization". Now we will go into breaking down our idea into it's smaller components.

#### Breaking it down

Now that we know, in layman's terms, what we're making, lets break it down into even simpler parts recursively. Look at the example idea. Because I defined it so simply, I can easily break down the example idea to these main attributes: multiplayer, space, sh'mup, customization. Now we go even deeper. Say, {multiplayer: PvP, friend system, chat system}, {space: proc-gen, huge maps, asteroids!}, {sh'mup: bullets everywhere, top-down, different guns/items/effects}, and {customization: parts, weapons, colors}. Many of the smaller aspects can still be broken down into even finer detail! Think about your idea, break it down just like that (or more if you feel it necessary), and *write it down*.

#### Conclusion

In this post you took your idea and found the many small components that make up the idea.  In boiling down your game to it's core, you've made clear what parts of your game need to be made. Next we will move on to identifying the core of our game.
