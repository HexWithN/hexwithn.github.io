title: My Goals And I
---

This being my first post, I'll speak a bit about me, what I do, and my goals.

On this blog I'll be posting a multitude of different things, from tutorials to life updates to game ideas to even philosophy. I'll also be posting recent videos to the blog.
Things like Math, English, and Philosophy will pop up because I am learning about them in school (I'm also learning about game dev, but blogging about that was a given ;).
Sharing knowledge with others seems like the Internet thing to do after all :P

The website itself will be the hub that connects all my social things and keeps my world in order. I'll put any games, art, or other cool softwares in the Works section.

By the writing of this post, I am still a newborn hatchling of 18 years, but my end goal is to become a world-famous game developer (or at least have made world-famous games).
This sounds like a pipe-dream to many, and for many this would be a pipe-dream, but it is not for me. I've decided to "just do it". As naive as that sounds, it's easy to get
things done with commitment and a checklist. That is, make small, obtainable goals for yourself that will lead up to the end goal, and check them off one-by-one.

Already, I have quite a few boxes ticked on my list. For one, I've been a self-learned programmer since the age of ten. I started with actual languages like C++, Java, and
JavaScript. I can confidently say that I'm a programmer (:D). As well, I've been a designer since the age of zero. Drawing and imagining cool things, like flying motorcycles
and four-winged birds, has always been a hobby of mine. That being said, I always knew that I wanted to be a game developer, so
by the start of my third year in high school, I already knew what college I wanted: Rochester Institute of Technology.

At this time, I am now a student at RIT (check). RIT is a school famous for it's game design degree. More importantly, being here has shown me that there are others, who don't
live in California, and who are interested in game dev as well! So far I've even participated in two Game Jam (where developers gather and make games, sometimes competitively),
one of them, the Global Game Jam, being hosted at my school! Not only do I get the chance to learn a ton of stuff, but I also get to take part in massive dev events like Global Game Jam,
AND IT'S HOSTED AT MY CAMPUS. So yeah, RIT is super fun.

Anyways, lets talk about goals. You already know my long-term goal: to become the Ultimate Super Game Developer, but I have short-term goals that build up to that. For one, staying on top
of social media to keep up with the game dev world instead being a recluse, which is all too easy for us developers. Also, this blog! I'll be maintaining this blog daily, sharing updates
on my social media pages. Even if my day was super boring, I'll at least say hello to the world. Most importantly, in order to keep it interesting and stay relevant in the world of
game development, I'll be developing! Daily, something will be made - something graphical and appreciable nonetheless. These are the short-term goals that will build up to becoming
an Over-9000 Mega Legendary Ex Game Dev.

Wow, that was a lot. But that's me :P

See you next post!
