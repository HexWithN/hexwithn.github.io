#### Introduction

Graphical Mathematics is like algebra and trigonometry with just a few new concepts that make it graphical. This study's range spans from point and vector manipulation to 3D computations. But do not be alarmed! This blog series will cover the basics, only. Furthermore, I will explain the concepts as intuitively as possible.

You are now viewing part 3 of the tutorial series. In this part, we'll cover slopes, the point-slope formula, the equation of a line, and how to find the x-intercept and y-intercepts of a line.

<br/>
Let's Begin!

#### Slope of a line

The slope of a line is defined as the rise over the run. That is, the change in y-position (\\( \Delta y\\)) over the change in x-position (\\( \Delta x\\)) of two points in the line.

		<p>  \\( \frac 32 \\) | 3 units up over 2 units right </p>
	</figcaption>

#### The Point-Slope Formula

Given a point \\( (x\_1, y\_1) \\) of a line, and slope \\( m \\) of the line, we can describe the line algebraically, in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), using the *point-slope formula*:

$$ y - y\_1 = m(x - x\_1) $$

Again, the above is called the point-slope formula. After substituting the given values of the point on the line and the slope, we can simplify the equation to get the more standard form of a line:

$$ y = mx + b $$

In this case, \\( b \\) is equal to \\( -mx\_1 + y\_1 \\).

		<p> Point-slope form: \\( y - 4 = 3(x - 2) \\) </p>
		<p> This is right too: \\( y - 1 = 3(x - 1) \\) </p>
		How about standard form?
		<p> Standard form: \\( y = 3x - 2 \\) </p>

</figure>

#### X-Intercept and Y-Intercept

Once you can get a line in standard form, you will be able to determine the x-intercept and y-intercept quite easily. For the line in the form \\( y = mx + b \\) the y-intercept of the line is b. To find the x-intercept, simply switch the variables of the equation around until you are solving for x. You will find \\( x = \frac ym - \frac bm \\), where \\( -\frac bm \\) is your x-intercept.

Try it out:

		What is the y-intercept of this line?
		<p> -2 </p>
		What is the x-intercept?
		<p> 2/3 </p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Conclusion

We have reviewed slope, the point-slope formula, and how to find the intercepts of a line by the point slope formula. Not only do we understand the concepts geometrically, but we can also describe them algebraically. Now that that's done, lets move our focus back to the main point of the series: Graphical Mathematics.

If you've looked through the settings of your computer, tv, or even a game, you may have seen aspect ratio before. Don't worry, it'll be simple !
