#### Introduction

At a glance, making a game should be extremely easy. You get an idea, everything makes perfect sense, and it should be simple to make. However, there are things in between going from an idea to a reality that we tend to forget. These are the problems that make game developers simply flop. Worst still, these problems apply to all things, not just games. Amazing innovations and ideas have died off because these problems were not addressed.

Many developers I know suffer from scope-creep, or just overscoping in general for that matter. They have an idea, and at some point before or during development, they think "what if we added this here?" or "we should do this too!", and the project goes from a simple RPG to a medieval life simulator. Even developers at EA have problems with it, as shown by this [Polygon article by Emily Gera](http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/8/13/3239083/battlefield-1942-was-a-textbook-example-of-over-scoping). Overscoping in games is explained in more detail in this [article by Ian Garstang](http://www.gamingdebugged.com/2013/01/12/the-over-scoping-game-designer-the-attack-of-the-feature-creep/).

Other developers I know, including myself, suffer from lack of motivation. Either it wasn't there in the first place, or we go into our projects with an enthusiastic roar, then a quarter of the way through it becomes a drag, and at some point we just stop working on it. [This article by Carolyn VanEseltine](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/CarolynVanEseltine/20150609/245543/Motivation_for_the_Solo_Indie_Game_Dev_with_commentary_by_yayfrens.php) can help you more specifically with motivation.

The most important problem that affects every new developer I know, and from which the other two problems can be traced, is poor planning. So many developers suffer from poor planning, and not for lack of trying, but for lack of experience and pace. But poor planning can be avoided, and by extension, all of the above problems! This blog will explain and remedy the problem of poor planning.

By following this blog, you will not only come out with a simple game to tinker with, but you'll also have a firm solution for the above problems, should they arise in your quest.

Let's Begin!

#### Proper Planning

Lack of proper planning is the one problem from which almost every other problem stems. Be it while developing games or going on a first date, failing to plan your steps can be disastrous.

Just as there are steps to the making of the game, there are steps the the planning of it. Firstly, we must figure out what we are making. This may seem obvious to the point of patronizing, but really, it's not as intuitive as you think. Once we have a more detailed idea of what we're making, the next step is to break it down into it's basic components. This step can be harder to grasp, as it can be hard to judge if you've *really* broken down any one component enough (or even too much :P). Once we've broken the idea down, we can find the core idea of the game. This core idea is what we'll be making first and foremost.

##### Step 1: What are we making?

Take a moment to imagine, in your head, the idea that brought you here. If you didn't come with an idea, here's one: A multiplayer space sh'mup with customization. If you did come with an idea, try to define it in specific terms like I just did with my idea. A one-line description is enough. If you can't fit in into one line, keep thinking! Got it? Great. You just defined what we'll be making. Create a document or even get a piece of paper and *write your idea down*. That is so important, and one of the things many developers neglect to do. Writing down your ideas and thought process can save you so much time and stress later on.

##### Step 2: Breaking it down

Now that we know, in layman's terms, what we're making, lets break it down into even simpler parts recursively. Look at the example idea. Because I defined it so simply, I can easily break down the example idea to these main attributes: multiplayer, space, sh'mup, customization. Now we go even deeper. Say, {multiplayer: PvP, friend system, chat system}, {space: proc-gen, huge maps, asteroids!}, {sh'mup: bullets everywhere, top-down, different guns/items/effects}, and {customization: parts, weapons, colors}. Many of the smaller aspects can still be broken down into even finer detail! Think about your idea, break it down just like that (or more if you feel it necessary), and *write it down*.

##### Step 3: Identify the core

This will be easier for some more than others. You have to unmarry yourself from every single aspect of the idea you have in mind. Look at it objectively and think: At the very base of things, what is this game? For example, Halo is a multiplayer sci-fi fps with a unique storyline and character customization. Alternatively, Halo is a first-person shooter. Basically, you want to focus on identifying the genre of your idea. The core of the example idea would be "sh'mup". Be sure to write that down too. It would also be a good idea to label it as "Core Game" and label every other aspect of your idea as "Features".

#### Conclusion

If you've made it to here, you've done well. But we've only scratched the surface! In this post you planned the first steps to making your game. In boiling down your game to it's core, you've set a clear and achievable goal and addressed the problem of scope creep. Next we will move on to the designing of our core game, then do a bit more planning.
