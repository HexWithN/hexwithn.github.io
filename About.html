                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Nazaire Shabaz, a student at RIT and an aspiring game developer. My strongest skills are programming and design, which are perfect for game development. I've always been a gamer, ever since I learned to code it's been my passion. It only made sense that I would put the two together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is my website as well as my portfolio. Here you will find my <a href="/Projects/">works, games</a>, and <a href="/Blog/">blog posts</a>. I do quite a few projects, from 3D art to game development, and I will blog on related topics, from game development to graphical mathematics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish to find me on social media or you want to send an email, all links are provided in the <a onclick="openMenu()">Menu</a>. Feel free to look around, and if you have any suggestions, ideas, or you just want to chat, do get in touch ! :)
                    </p>
